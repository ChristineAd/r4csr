# Welcome! {-}

Welcome to R for clinical study reports and submission. 
Clinical study reports (CSR) are essential parts of clinical trial development. 
A CSR is an "integrated" full scientific report of an individual clinical trial. 

The [ICH E3: structure and content of clinical study reports](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E3_Guideline.pdf) 
provides guidance to assist sponsors in the development of a CSR. 
In this book, you will learn how to use R to prepare a CSR and how to submit it to regulatory agencies. 

**This is the work-in-progress draft of the book.**
