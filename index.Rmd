Welcome to R for clinical study report and submission. 
Clinical study reports (CSR) are the essential part of clinical trials development. 
a CSR is an "integrated" full scientific report of an individual clinical trial. 

The [ICH E3: strcuture and content of clinical study reports](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E3_Guideline.pdf) 
provide guidance to assist sponsors in the development of a CSR. 
In this book, you will learn how to use R to prepare CSR and submit to regulatory agency. 

This is the work-in-progress draft of the book.
