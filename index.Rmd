Welcome to R for clinical study reports and submission.
Clinical study reports (CSR) are essential parts of clinical trial development.
A CSR is an "integrated" full scientific report of an individual clinical trial.

The [ICH E3: structure and content of clinical study reports](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E3_Guideline.pdf)
provides guidance to assist sponsors in the development of a CSR.
In this book, you will learn how to use R to prepare a CSR and
how to submit it to regulatory agencies.

**This is a work-in-progress draft.**
