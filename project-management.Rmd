A clearly defined software development lifecycle (SDLC) for the programming of A&R deliverables is crucial to manage all
the outputs and to facilitate the development of the deliverables.
A typical SDLC for the A&R deliverables is comprised of 4 stages: define, develop, validate and operations.
The define stage is the most critical stage in the lifecycle as the requirements for all A&R deliverables are
gathered and documented. Validation plan for the deliverables is also planned and documented at this
stage. After the define stage is complete, the programming development occurs in the develop stage. The
programs completed in the develop stage are then validated according to the validation plan in the validate
stage. Test runs of the completed programs are conducted to ensure quality of the deliverables.
The development of programs and their associated validation is usually carried out in a dedicated test area
in the computing platform. After the validation stage is completed, the operations stage commences with
the promotion of validated programs to the production area in the computing platform. The promoted
programs are then executed in the production area with production data to generate the final version of the
deliverables. The deliverables are then handed over to the end customer for review. Any changes in
requirements of the deliverables at this stage based on end customer review, results in the deliverable
being processed through the 4 stages of SDLC again, starting with the changes to the specifications in the
define stage.
Several different software and programming languages have used in analyzing clinical trial data, with R
being among them. R is a popular programming language and an open-source software environment. R
has been widely used in various fields of data analytics for statistical analyses. There is a growing interest
within the pharmaceutical industry in analyzing clinical trial data using R and its associated software under
a regulatory environment. However, there is a gap in defining the appropriate SDLC to complete typical
A&R deliverables and ensure regulatory compliance.
